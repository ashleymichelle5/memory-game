# Memory game - Inside Out 

## **Description**: 
In this **Inside Out-themed** memory game, you have ***50 seconds*** to find and match ***9 pairs of cards***. Flip over two cards at a time to reveal their images and try to remember their locations. If you match all 9 pairs within the time limit, you win. If time runds out before you complete the game, it's game over...
